TRGA
==========
This is a demo of TRGA which contains the source code of TRGA and corresponding integrated fault localization techniques (Barinel, Ochiai, Dstar, Mseer, FLC (also called J2 in the source code file)), further, all faulty versions and their corresponding execution files of program Mockito have been given for better understanding.

Introduction
===
* Mockito -- The folder Mockito gives the detailed execution information of available faulty versions of program Mockito from Defects4J dataset. All faulty versions that can not be compiled or produce a runtime error are discarded.
    #matrix--the execution spectrum of each executable statement, including the execution result in the last column.
    #spectra--the detailed information about each executable statement.
* TRGA_Barinel -- The folder TRGA_Barinel gives the source code of TRGA with Barinel technique.
* TRGA_Ochiai -- The folder TRGA_Barinel gives the source code of TRGA with Ochiai technique.
* TRGA_Dstar -- The folder TRGA_Barinel gives the source code of TRGA with Dstar technique.
* TRGA_Clustering -- The folder TRGA_Barinel gives the source code of TRGA with two clustering techniques (Mseer and FLC).
